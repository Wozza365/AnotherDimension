```
1. Design and Features 13/15

Enjoyable to play, 
few issues for example picking up weapons of a different type adds ammo to current weapon too, 
I can also have negative health, but a solid and fun experience.

2. Game Behaviour 54/60

 Collision detection is complex, appropriate and successful. 
 The AI is good but feels a bit rigid at times, 
 rather than a shambling zombie a soldier on a route march but otherwise is exceptional.

3. Implementation and Code 12/15

Code quality is good, little verbose in comments in places though.

4. Demonstration 10/10

## About this project
Physics and AI frameworks with a small game to demonstrate the features of the custom frameworks. Written in C# using MonoGame as a graphics and input wrapper.

## Features include:
 - Simple forces
 - Box, circle collisions
 - Polygon-to-polygon collisions (using my own algorithm originating from circle-line collisions)
 - A-Star pathfinding
 - Path smoothing
 - Topdown and platforming sections
 - Shooting mechanics with 3 weapons
 - Projectiles, ladders and external forces such as fans
 - Potentially unlimited maps with full support for maps built with Tiled
